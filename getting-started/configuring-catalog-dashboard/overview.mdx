Once you've set up your account, you can use the Dashboard to manage your **apps** and **team**. Use the Applications page of the Dashboard to create and manage new apps for your account. Resources within Catalog, including wallets, policies, users and more are scoped to individual apps. Use different apps to segregate development environments, userbases, API credentials, and more.

Use the Team page of the Dashboard to invite team members with different role permissions. Catalog supports three team roles—Admin, Developer, and Viewer—each with specific permissions tailored to different responsibilities. [Learn more about team roles](/getting-started/configuring-catalog-dashboard/teammate-roles).
