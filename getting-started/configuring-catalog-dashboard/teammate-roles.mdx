To keep your Catalog app secure, Catalog supports role based access control so you can limit different teammate's access permissions in the Dashboard. There are three teammate roles with different levels of access to your dashboard and account settings. Each role provides specific permissions designed to support different responsibilities within your organization.

## Role overview

| Role          | Access Level  | Primary Use Case                                                                               |
| :------------ | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**     | Full access   | Team leads, account owners, and senior developers who need complete control                    |
| **Developer** | Most features | Developers who need to build and configure applications                                        |
| **Viewer**    | Read-only     | Stakeholders, support engineers, and teammates who need visibility without editing permissions |

## Managing team roles

Only Admins can invite new teammates and assign roles.

### Inviting teammates

1. Navigate to the Team page in your dashboard
2. Click "Invite teammate"
3. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
4. Select their role from the dropdown menu
5. Click "Send invitation"

### Changing roles

Admins can update teammate roles at any time:

1. Go to the Team page
2. Find the teammate whose role you want to change
3. Click on their current role dropdown
4. Select the new role
5. Confirm the change

### Removing teammates

Only Admins can remove teammates from the account:

1. Navigate to the Team page
2. Find the teammate you want to remove
3. Click the "Remove" button next to their name
4. Confirm the removal

Removing a teammate immediately revokes their access to your Catalog dashboard and all associated applications.

## Best practices

### Role assignment guidelines

- **Start with Viewer access**: Give new teammates Viewer access initially to let them familiarize themselves with your setup
- **Use Developer for most technical work**: Developers can handle day-to-day application building and configuration
- **Limit Admin access**: Only assign Admin roles to team leads and senior developers who need full account control

### Security considerations

- **Regularly review teammate access**: Audit your teammates and their roles periodically
- **Use the principle of least privilege**: Assign the minimum role necessary for each teammate's responsibilities
- **Remove access promptly**: When teammates leave your organization, remove their access immediately

Need help determining the right role for a teammate? Consider their daily responsibilities and start with the most restrictive role that allows them to complete their work.
