Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your Catalog Dashboard account. By requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password, MFA helps protect your account from unauthorized access.

## Why enable MFA?

### Security Benefits

- **Prevent Unauthorized Access**: Even if someone gets your password, they can't access your account without the second factor
- **Protect Sensitive Data**: Your dashboard contains application configurations, user data, and API keys
- **Compliance**: Many organizations require MFA for security compliance
- **Peace of Mind**: Know that your account is protected with industry-standard security

### Risk Mitigation

- **Password Breaches**: Protects against compromised passwords from data breaches
- **Phishing Attacks**: Prevents access even if you fall for a phishing scam
- **Shared Credentials**: Reduces risk if credentials are accidentally shared
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Adds protection against automated login attempts
